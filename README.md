# coconat

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of *coconat* is to provide dataset agnostic support for connectome analysis.

It is intended to have a mix of end-user functionality and functions that are
principally intended as building blocks for more specialised packages such as
https://natverse.org/neuprintr/ or https://natverse.org/fafbseg/

## Installation

You can install the development version of coconat from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("natverse/coconat")
```
